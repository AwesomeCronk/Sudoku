# Sudoku
A project to test myself on Python, data handling, and GUIs

Utilizes a handwritten sudoku game engine, containing information types for rows, columns, and subgrids. This makes for easy error checking in the game board and really put my OOP skills to the test. I made this game engine capable of holding a text-based game of sudoku in the Python terminal, then moved on to the GUI using PyQt5. I plan to revisit the game engine to add a solver algorithm once I have the GUI version playable.
